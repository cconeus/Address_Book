## Description

This application uses a straight forward class to gather user input and display it back to them on the home page. It is a three page application,
which includes a home page for displaying both the user contacts on the left, and a form for inputting new contacts on the right.
It also contains a confirmation page which displays the most recently entered information, and deletion confirmation page to show that all items have been removed.
The code in this app can be used for basically any sort of user input and is stored in the $_SESSION variable on the users local machine.
